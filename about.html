        <h3>How it started ?</h3>
        <p>
          My reason for murder is complex, My strong homicidal urges originated
          from when I was traumatized at age three by watching the brutal
          chainsaw murder of my mother, Laura Moser. That event made me feel as
          if I was "born in blood" as a "monster." At age twenty, I began to
          kill and cut up my victims, similar to the way my mother had
          died.Unlike most serial killers, I had someone to teach me how to
          control and hone my urge to kill based on a rule set, which is the
          Code of Harry.
